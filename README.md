# 1st-COMMIT-A-grade-calculator
For my 1st attempt ever, I made a grade calculator. If I put the score, it will show me the grade A-f, while be able to point out if there is a unvalid enter. I wanted to make it able to let the user re-enter the score when there is an unvalid score. There must be a faster, smarter beter way to code, right? I still do not know it though.
