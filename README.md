# 1st-COMMIT-A-grade-calculator
For my 1st attempt ever, I made a grade calculator. If I put the score, it will show me the grade A-f, while be able to point out if there is a unvalid enter. I wanted to make it able to let the user re-enter the score when there is an unvalid score. There must be a faster, smarter beter way to code, right? I still do not know it though.
At first, you will enter your score like 95, and then it will give you the corresponding grade for that score. If you pur unvalid scores, like -90, it will give you an error message asking you to retry.
